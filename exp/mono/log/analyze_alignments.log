Overall, sil accounts for 1.3% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (9,20.0,55) frames.
The optional-silence phone sil occupies 1.9% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 88.7% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 2.1% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.5 hours of data, or 0.5 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 1.4% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (9,20.0,55)
